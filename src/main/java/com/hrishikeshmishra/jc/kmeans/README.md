Steps: 
    1. No. of cluster must be known to be K.
    2. K no. of cluster centers such that they are farthest apart from each other. 
    3. Consider each data points and assign it to the cluster which is closet. 
    4. Recalculate cluster centers by finding mean of data point belonging to the same clusters. 
    5. Repeat setup 3 & 4 till shifting of cluster centers are observed. 
     
Usages: 
    1. Data mining 
    2. Machine Learning
